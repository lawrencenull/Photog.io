Photog.io
=========

__Photog.io__ is an open-source, self-hosted image sharing platform. Users on your Photog.io site can follow users on any other Photog.io site thanks to the [PubSubHubbub](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/) protocol.

Photog.io is made possible thanks to the following technologies:
	* [CodeIgniter PHP Framework](http://CodeIgniter.com/)
	* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
	* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
	* [Paul Irish's Infinite Scroll](https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll)
	* Various HTML5 enhancements such as [getUserMedia()](http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html)

Photog.io is very much a work-in-progress, so many features are broken or nonexistent at this time. If you find a bug please file a report or submit a patch. Pull requests are greatly appreciated at this early stage of development! :)

Goals
=====
* Simple to install
* Easy to upload/import photos
* A snap to download/export photos
* Effortless to view photos through the responsive web app

Inspiration
===========
* Ease of installation and open source (self hosted) like WordPress
	* (users are always in complete control of their data)
* Instagram’s design sense
	* (very easy and fun to take pictures with)
* Reddit’s homepage is visually similar whether you’re logged-in or not
* Tumblr’s minimalistic dashboard and infinite scrolling
* Imgur’s ease of uploading
	* (drag and drop)
* Personality and playfulness of Flickr
	* (saying “hello” in different languages)

Where Photog.io differs
=======================
* Users on one server can follow users on a different server (like in the days of RSS)
* Highly focused on web-app rather than native iOS/Android app
* Strives to be even more minimalistic than tumblr or instagram
	* Leave out everything that’s not completely essential
	* Make the most of every available space without making it feel cramped
	* Don't give users options they don't want, care about, or need
